symbols n (how many symbols were defined)
n*{
    S m e u (S - symbol itself, m - binding {0 - extern, 1 - local, 2 - global}, e - if it is an 'equ', u - how many times is the symbol used)
    <section b> (section - where the symbol is defined, b - which byte), exists only for non-extern symbols
    <operand, is_symbol>* (operand - an operand from equ definition, is_symbol - is it a symbol or an int), exists only for 'equ'-defined symbols
    <operator>* (list of operators used ini equ)
    u*{
        section b w (section - where the symbol is used, b - which byte, w - whether its whole 32b or just the D in instruction)
    }
